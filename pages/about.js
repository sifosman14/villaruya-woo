          <p className="text-gray-700 text-xl mb-6">
            Villaruya was founded in 2018 by a group of friends who shared a love of beautiful, high-quality towels. We were inspired by the traditional Turkish towels that we discovered on a trip to Istanbul, and we knew that we wanted to share these amazing products with the world.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-xl mb-6">
            Since then, we have worked tirelessly to create the perfect towel, sourcing the best materials and collaborating with talented designers to create unique and beautiful products that our customers love. We are proud to offer a wide range of towels, from classic striped designs to modern geometric patterns, and we are always working to innovate and improve our products.
